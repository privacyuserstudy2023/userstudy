<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>This privacy policy describes how Pargee LLC (Justin Kovac) ("Pargee LLC", "us" or "we") protects your ("you", "the user") privacy and your data. Before using any of our Alexa Skills ("our skills"), please read this policy and our <a href="http://pargee.com/alexa-terms.html">Alexa Skills Terms of Use</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201809740">Alexa Terms of Use</a> and the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/privacy">Privacy Policies</a> by the Amazon Digital Services LLC (with its affiliates, "Amazon").</p>
<p>Regarding Amazon, "Alexa" means their Alexa Voice Service which includes third party services (like our skills) and other related Software.</p>
<p>If you use one of our skills you fully agree to this privacy policy.</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>When you use our skills you have to talk to Alexa. This voice input is sent to Amazon and returned to us as an approximated string defined as an intent, where we use it to understand what our skill should do for you. This is absolutely necessary for our service to give you an appropriate answer.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>We do not collect or share personally identifiable data within our skills.</p>
<p>To improve our services, we automatically analyze how often utterances are spoken and other events through users. This is done automatically by Amazon in the Amazon Developer Console.</p>
<p>For some of our skills, it is necessary to save data for you into our databases. This data is only connected to your Alexa in the form of an obfuscated user ID, but never to your name or any other personal information with exception to Time Zone. In the case of our "7-Minute Workout" skill we save how many workouts users performed and of what type.</p>
<h3>Changes</h3>
<p>Our skills or parts of it may change or be updated at any time. Further, this Privacy Policy may change. You can find a link to this policy on the description page of the skill in the Alexa App or in the Alexa Store. Your continued use of our skill after changes of the Privacy Policy or the skill itself will be seen as your acceptance of both.</p>
