Information We Collect

The information we collect about users varies depending upon the circumstances and the Services used.

GSN collects personal information directly from users, automatically related to the use of the Services, and in some cases, from third parties (such as social networks, platform providers, payment processors, and operators of certain third party services that we use).

Information We Collect From You. Generally we collect your personal information when you voluntarily provide it to us. However, if you decline to provide us with certain personal information, you may not be able to access certain Services or we may be unable to fully respond to your inquiry. We generally collect the following personal information from you:

Registration and profile information: to access and use certain Services (e.g., to register and create an account, download or use a mobile application, access subscription-based Services,) you must register with us, by providing us with certain required information, which is identified on the registration page. Depending upon the Services you use, this may include your name, a user name and password, age, address, occupation, as well as country and city of residence, cable provider, email, and contact information, including telephone number; certain Services will not be available if you decline to provide required information. We may also ask you or allow you to submit additional information, which may include your preferences, a profile picture, and other profile information. If you sign up for marketing communications from us, we collect your email address, and we may also collect your name, preferences, and if relevant, information about your account and the Services and other games you use.
Contestants and other show participants: we may collect information about you in connection with participation in one of our shows, such as your name, age, phone number, email and other contact information, current location and residency, occupation, social interests show preferences, and other demographic information. We may also run background checks on you in order to consider your application to be a contestant. If you participate in one of our shows, we may also collect footage and images related to the show you participated in.
Administering contests and prizes: if you participate in one of our events, including shows, contests and sweepstakes, we collect information about you to administer the contest registration and prize acceptance, including to announce winners on and off air.
Purchases and payments: if you make a purchase or sign up for certain subscription-based Services, you are required to provide your payment information, including name, billing and shipping address and details, payment type, as well as credit card number. We work with third party payment processors and fulfillment partners to process these payments. We do not collect, receive, process or store credit card or debit card numbers; this information is collected directly by these third parties. Depending upon the Service, we may receive your username, name, email, the payment type, product(s) or service(s), and other transaction details, and maintain records of your purchase and subscription history. For clarification and the removal of doubt, in instances where you are required to authenticate your cable, satellite or internet service provider subscription in order to view content on our Service, GSN will not collect your personal information in connection with your viewing practices.
Events: we may also run contests, sweepstakes or other events or activities (collectively, “events”) on our websites and social media channels. Information collected for these events may include your name, age, email address, and other personal or demographic information.
Surveys: we collect certain information from you, such as preferences and demographic information, if you choose to participate in one of our focus groups or surveys. Such information is generally used for internal purposes, for example to improve our Services.
Your communications: when you email us, call us, or otherwise send us communications regarding the Services, we collect and maintain a record of your contact details, communications and our responses.
Information We Collect and Receive From Third Parties. We may collect and receive personal information about you from third parties, such as:

Casting agencies: we receive personal information about individuals that are referred to us by a casting agency to participate in one of our shows.
Social networks: GSN may offer you the possibility to connect your accounts from third party social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter (each, a “Social Networking Site”). By allowing GSN to connect with your accounts on such Social Networking Sites, you consent to GSN’s accessing the information in those accounts, which information may include personal information. It is your choice whether to use any such Social Networking Site, and you understand that in some instances such Social Networking Sites may request to access and publish information about you or your friends that is included in your GSN Account. If you post about us or our content or interact with us on a Social Networking Site, we may collect information about such content or interaction on that Social Networking Site.
Marketing partners: we receive personal information about individuals in cases where we have arrangements with promotional partners or retailers, whereby they share with us personal information collected on their website (for example in case of a co-branded promotion event). In the event that we receive such information we combine it with our customer records.
Third parties and analytics: we also may use third party tools to help us manage and analyze our social media presence, or other public channels and forums, such as analytics services. The information collection and sharing practices of these third parties are subject to their respective terms and conditions and privacy policies.
Identifiers: when you access or use our Services through a Third Party Platform, we may collect or receive your device identifier(s), such as IP address, MAC address, and other device identifiers.
Viewing data: we may collect information about our content that you view online, including through third party services. If you have authenticated with your cable provider full access to our content, we only receive de-identified data about viewing content.
Information We Collect Automatically. We collect personal information about how you use the Services and interact with us and others, such as information we collect automatically (e.g., using cookies and pixel tags), as well as information we derive about you and your use of the Services.

We may also use pixels to collect information about how individuals interact with our Services, for example if they read the emails we send to them. See the Cookies and Other Tracking Information section below for more information.
Location data: certain of the Services, such as our location-enabled mobile applications, may capture and record actual geolocation and general location data about you, your IP address, or the device you use to access the Services. We may also link location data to other information that we have about you or collect in connection with your use of the relevant Services. You can stop all collection of information by our GSN mobile applications by uninstalling the app. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the GSN app.
App identifier: when you install or uninstall a GSN mobile application, it may contain a unique GSN app number and that number may be sent to us. Information about your installation, for example, the type of operating system, may also be sent to us.
Other data: if you visit a physical GSN location, we may use CCTV and other security monitoring to secure our premises, which may lead to the collection of personal information about visitors to our premises.

Cookies and Tracking

We and our third-party providers use cookies, clear GIFs/pixel tags, JavaScript, local storage, log files, and other mechanisms to automatically collect and record information about your browsing activities, and use of the Websites and other Services. We may combine this “usage data” with other personal information we collect about you. We use this usage data to understand how our Services are used, track bugs and errors, provide and improve our Services, verify account credentials, allow logins, track sessions, prevent fraud, and protect our Services, as well as for targeted marketing and advertising, to personalize content and for analytics purposes (see the Your Rights and Choices section below for information about opting-in out of certain uses of your personal information)

Cookies. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities while using our Site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Some of the Services may not work properly if you disable cookies.

Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (also referred to as web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Services to, among other things, track the activities users of our Services, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage of our Services. We and our service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.

Third-Party Analytics. We may use third-party analytics companies, for example Google Analytics (see privacy policy and opt-out) to evaluate use of our Services. We use these tools to help us understand use of, and to improve, our Services, ad campaigns, and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies, such as web beacons or local storage objects (LSOs), to perform their services.

Do Not Track (DNT). Our Sites currently do not respond to "do not track" signals. You may, however, disable certain tracking mechanisms in the cookie preference settings of your web browser and opt out of certain third party ad cookies on our websites.

Online and Interest Based Advertising

We may work with third parties to display and manage our advertising on third-party websites, mobile apps and online services or to display third party ads on the Services. We and these third party ad companies may use cookies, pixels tags, and other tools to collect activity information on our Services (as well as on third party sites and services), as well as IP address, device ID, cookie and advertising IDs, and other identifiers, general location information, and with your consent, your device’s geolocation information; advertisement(s) served, in game location, and length of time an advertisement was visible; we and these third party ad companies may use this information to provide you more relevant ads and content and to evaluate the success of such ads and content. We and the third party ad companies we work with may combine personal information collected through cookies and other online tools with other information we have about you.

Advertising GSN Products & Services. After you use certain of the Services, our advertising partners may deliver GSN ads to your web browser when you are visiting other sites on the Internet. These ads are delivered based on cookies that may be set by us or by our third party ad partners when you visit or use the Services, and that may be recognized by these companies when you visit other sites. Please see the Cookies and Tracking section to learn more about setting your web browser to block cookies.

Ad Choices. Certain third party ad companies participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising. As part of this program, consumers have an ability to opt out of behavioral (targeted) advertising. Pursuant to these principles, you may control how participating third party ad companies use the information that they collect about your visits to our websites and Services, and those of third parties, in order to display more relevant targeted advertising to you. For more information or to opt out of third party advertising cookies and tags on our Sites, go to www.privacyrights.info. You may also obtain more information about targeted or “interest-based advertising” by visiting www.aboutads.info/choices (Digital Advertising Alliance(US)) or www.youradchoices.ca/choices/ (Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada).

Opting out of participating ad networks does not opt you out of being served advertising. You may continue to receive generic or “contextual” ads on our Services. You may also continue to receive targeted ads on other websites, from companies that do not participate in the above programs.

Children

GSN Services are not directed or targeted at children under 16 years of age. If you are a parent or guardian who has discovered that your child has submitted his or her personal information to GSN, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete the information from its database, at your request. To request the deletion of your child’s information, please email us at tvhelp@gsn.com and be sure to include in your message the same member name and password that your child submitted.

Data Security

We have implemented a variety of safeguards designed to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of electronic transmission or storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.

Third Party Links

The Services may contain links to, or advertisements concerning, other websites. Other websites may also reference, advertise, or link to GSN. GSN is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites and expressly disclaims all liability associated with your use of, and the content on, such other websites and advertisements. You should check the applicable privacy policy of any website you may click through to.

Consent to Processing in the United States

The Services are operated in the United States. By providing any personal information to the Services, all users fully understand and unambiguously consent to this Policy. By using our Services, participating in any of our Services and/or providing us with your information, you consent and agree to the collection, transfer, storage and processing of your information to and in the United States.

Changes to this Policy

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, update, add to, discontinue, remove or otherwise change any portion of this Policy, in whole or in part, at any time.
