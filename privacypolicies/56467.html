<h3>1. Acceptance of the Terms of Service</h3>
<p>Welcome to <strong>AnyMote - Smart Remote</strong>! (a.k.a. "<strong>we</strong>" or "<strong>us</strong>" or the  "<strong>Company</strong>"). 
We are excited to have you as user and member of  the community. The following terms and conditions 
(collectively, these "<strong>Terms  of Service</strong>") apply to your use of <strong>AnyMote - Smart Remote</strong> (</strong>the<strong> "Application")</strong>,  including any content, 
functionality and services offered on or via ColorTiger.com and appnimator.com (the "<strong>Websites</strong>"). </p>
<p>We want to keep our  relationship with you as lean and informal as 
possible, but please read the  Terms of Service carefully before you 
start using AnyMote - Smart Remote, because <strong>by  using the Applications you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these  Terms of Service</strong>.</p>
<p>Should you disagree with some  of the provisions herein, you can 
either uninstall the Application (although  we'll be sad to see you 
go!), or contact us at support@colortiger.com.&nbsp;</p>

change in the near future. We reserve the  right to update the 
Application, and these Terms of Service from  time to time, 
at our discretion. We will make sure to announce any major change  in a 
prominent way, but since "major" is a very subjective concept, you can 
always email us if you have any concerns or would like to be notified of all changes.

that you accept and agree to the changes.</strong></p>
