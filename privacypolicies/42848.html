<p><strong>“Do Not Sell My Personal Information” (California Residents only)</strong></p>
<p>California residents may opt out of the “sale” of their personal information. California law broadly defines “sale” in a way that may include allowing third parties to receive certain information such as cookies, IP address, device identifiers or other hashed identifiers, interests, browsing behavior and/or other activity to add to a profile about your device, browser, or you. This profile enables marketing to you and delivery of interest-based advertising on the NBCUniversal Services or other sites. Advertising, including interest-based advertising, enables NBCUniversal to provide you certain content for free and provide relevant offers to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on what Services you use, we may share the following categories of information for such purposes which may be considered a sale (as defined by California law):</p>
<ul>
<li>identification and demographics; device information and identifiers, such as IP address, and unique advertising identifiers and cookies; connection and usage information, such as browsing history or app usage; hashed identifiers (contact information), geolocation information, such as city; and inference data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you or your authorized agent would like to opt out of NBCUniversal’s use of your information for such purposes (to the extent this is considered a sale), you may do so as outlined on the following page: <a href="https://www.nbcuniversal.com/privacy/notrtoo">Do Not Sell My Personal Information</a>.</p>
