<p><strong>LIFE360 Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>This Privacy Policy was last modified on November 10, 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>WELCOME</strong></p>
<p>Life360, Inc ("<strong>Life360</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>", or "<strong>us</strong>") is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.</p>
<p>Life360 operates a service that allows you to speak to and share your location with other users in your family or friendship group (each group, a&nbsp;"<strong>Circle</strong>"), which we make available through our apps and our website https://www.life360.com (the "<strong>Service</strong>").</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, and protection of personal information that is collected through our Service, as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information.</p>
<p>Our Service is available in many countries, which may have different standards and requirements in respect of the information we provide in the Privacy Policy and how we use personal information.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is therefore made up of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 sets out information applicable to users outside the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the UK; and</li>
<li>Part 2 sets out information applicable to users in the European Economic Area, Switzerland or the UK.</li>
<li>If you are a resident of the State of California in the United States, please click <a href="#ccpa" target="_self">here</a> for additional California-specific privacy information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before accessing or using our Service, please ensure that you have read and understood how we collect, store, use and disclose your personal information as described in the part of this Privacy Policy that is relevant to you.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1 – Privacy Policy for non-EEA users</strong></p>
<p>This Part 1 of our Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose and protect information that is collected through our Service from users outside the European Economic Area, &nbsp;Switzerland or the UK, as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information.</p>
<p>This Part 1 of the Privacy Policy was last modified on November 10, 2021.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>
<p><strong>Registration and Profile Information.</strong>&nbsp;When you create an account, we may collect your personal information such as your username, first and last name, email address, mobile phone number. We may collect a photo, if you or a Circle member associate a photo with your account. If you want to add a family member’s name to your account, we collect the family member’s name, email address, and mobile phone number. We may also collect billing information when you sign up for Premium service.</p>
<p><strong>Data collected through use of the Service.&nbsp;</strong>After you set up your account, we may ask for other profile and demographic information, such as personal emergency instructions and information, and nickname. You may also customize your map by labeling locations, such as “work” and “home,” to make it easy to spot your favorite places and to provide alerts when family members leave and arrive.</p>
<p><strong>Geolocation.</strong> We collect your location information through your IP address, WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS coordinates (e.g., latitude/longitude) available through your mobile device. We may also gather information about your location using other technologies and sensors which may provide us with information about nearby devices, WiFi access points and networks, and nearby cell towers. We collect and maintain location data to provide you the features and functionality of the Service. We may also share location information with our partners, such as <a href="https://www.cuebiq.com/privacypolicy" target="_self"><u>Cuebiq </u></a>and its <a href="https://www.cuebiq.com/trusted-partners/" target="_self"><u>Partners</u></a>, for tailored advertising, attribution, analytics, research and other purposes, as described in Section 2 “Sharing of Your Information” below. If&nbsp;you want to opt-out of the collection of your location data, please adjust your settings in your mobile device to limit the app’s access to your location data. Please see “Your Choices About Your Information” below to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>Driving Event Data.</strong> We collect, and may use a third party partner to collect, sensory and motion data from your smartphone or mobile device, including information from the gyroscope, accelerometer, compass and Bluetooth, in order to calculate and detect driving events such as speeding, hard braking, crash detection and other events. Your mobile device provider may refer to this information as “Motion and Fitness” data (description may vary according to device and platform). We may also share this information with third party partners for marketing, research, analytics and other purposes. If&nbsp;you want to opt-out of the collection of your sensory and motion, please adjust your settings in your mobile device to limit the app’s access to your sensory and motion data. Please see “Your Choices About Your Information” below to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>Messages and User Content.</strong> We collect information when you message other members of your Circle through use of the service. We may also retain any messages you send to us.</p>
<p>We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service and to communicate directly with you, such as to send you alerts on the movements of your Circle, crime alerts in your neighborhood, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media.</strong>&nbsp;When you interact with our site through various social media, such as when you Like us on Facebook or post a comment to our Facebook page, we may receive information from the social network such as your profile information, profile picture, gender, user name, user ID associated with your social media account, age range, language, country, friends list, and any other information you permit the social network to share with third parties. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to Life360’s website or Service.</p>
<p><strong>Identity verification.</strong> In limited circumstances, we may use identity verification services provided by a third-party provider Berbix to verify your age and/or to obtain verifiable parental consent for your child to use the Service. When identity verification is required, we will ask you to upload an image of your valid government-issued ID along with a selfie image. Our identify verification provider will use a combination of machine learning tools and optical scans to authenticate your identity document, and may use facial recognition technology to produce a unique biometric identifier based on facial geometry that can be used to compare your selfie to the image on the identity document you provided to determine the likelihood that the images are a "match." Life360 does not receive the biometric identifier generated from the images. It is generated and held by our identity verification provider until the biometric identifier is no longer needed for the purposes described in this paragraph, which will occur no later than 60 days after your last verification interaction with us.&nbsp;&nbsp; For identity verification and security purposes, Life360 may have access to the information extracted from the identity scan of the ID document (such as a name and partial driver’s license number) as well as the results of the identity verification process. We may use this process and associated information to verify your identity, authenticate your identity documents, confirm appropriate parental consent, and protect against fraud and misrepresentation.&nbsp; We do not use, disclose or retain your biometric information for any other commercial purpose. Our third-party provider processes this information on our behalf strictly in accordance with our contractual agreements. Please note this service may not be available in all jurisdictions.</p>
<p><strong>Information from third-party services.</strong> We collect information from third party services that you connect to your Life360 account. For example, if you link your Life360 account to a voice assistant platform to enable interaction with our service through voice commands, such as through the Life360 Google Action (“Action”) available on Google Assistant-enabled devices, we will collect the queries and commands applicable to Life360 that you make through the Action or other voice assistant platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Information we collect automatically through the use of technology.&nbsp;</strong>When you visit our website, use our mobile app, read our emails or otherwise engage with us, we and our business partners may automatically collect certain information about your computer or device through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, web beacons, log files, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, or other tracking/recording tools (collectively, “tracking technologies”), and we may combine this information with other personal information we collect about you. We use these tracking technologies to collect usage and device information, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about how you access the Service, for example, referral/exit pages, how frequently you access the Service, whether you open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the Service from multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Service.</li>
<li>Information about how you use the Service, for example, the features you use, the links you click, the ads you view and click on, purchase transaction information, your location when you access or interact with our Service, and other similar actions.</li>
<li>Information about the computer, tablet, smartphone or other device you use, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, platform type, device type/ model/ manufacturer, operating system, phone number, mobile carrier, date and time stamp, a unique ID that allows us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device or your account (including, for example, a UDID, IDFA, Google Ad ID, Windows Advertising ID or other persistent device identifier or Ad ID), battery life, and other such information. With your permission, we may also access your photo or camera roll.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools such as Google Analytics, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service and to understand more about the demographics of our users. You can learn more about Google’s practices at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners</a>, and view its currently available opt-out options at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>
<p>We use this information to (i) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service; (ii) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted content and advertising; (iii) track your location and movements; (iv) identify and contact you across multiple devices; (v) provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service and our marketing campaigns; (vi) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, users, traffic, and demographic patterns; (vii) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our Users or engineers that are associated with certain IP addresses or User IDs; and&nbsp;(viii) detect or prevent fraud or other harmful activities; (xi) automatically update our mobile application on your system and related devices; and (x) otherwise plan for and enhance our Service.</p>
<p>If you prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically reject cookies.&nbsp; Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using the Service, as some features and services on our Service may not work properly. Depending on your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies. These browser settings that block cookies may have no effect on non-cookie technologies. You may also set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and performed certain functions with it. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our Users, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We and our third party partners may also use information collected through tracking technologies for advertising purposes. Please see “Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising” below to learn more.</p>
<p><a name="partners"></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. SHARING OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal Information:&nbsp; </strong>We share your personal information with third parties outside the Company and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates in some circumstances, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We share your personal information, including name, email, precise location and driving event data, with others within your Circles.</li>
<li>We may share your personal information, including your precise location data, driving sensor data, unique identifiers or AD IDs and other data with our partners, such as <a href="https://www.cuebiq.com/privacypolicy" target="_self"><u>Cuebiq</u></a> and its <a href="https://www.cuebiq.com/trusted-partners/%20" target="_self"><u>Partners</u></a>, for their marketing and business purposes, including without limitation, to inform and improve tailored advertising, attribution, analytics or research purposes. These third party partners may use this information according to their own privacy policies. Please see “Your Choices About Your Information” to learn how you may be able to limit some third-party data sharing.</li>
<li>We share your personal information with Arity 875, LLC (“Arity”), which provides driving analytics behavior services to enable us to provide certain functionalities of the Service, such as driving event history and crash detection. We may share geolocation and movement data, mobile device information (such as information generated by the gyroscope and accelerometer in your device) and application analytics, including IP address and device identifiers, driving event data and information provided by you during your registration of a Life360 account or as part of your use of our Services. Arity uses this information to analyze your driving behaviors, such as speed, change in speed and other aspects of how, how much, where and when you drive in order to predict driving risk and calculate a driving risk score. Arity also uses this information to improve its analytics and predictive driving behavior models and improving its service generally. <br>For US users only, Arity may use this information to provide personalized content including targeted advertising, offer discounts, rewards or pricing offers by third parties such as insurance companies, and for other commercial purposes. Please see “Your Choices About Your Information” to learn how you may be able to limit some of this data sharing with Arity. To learn more about how Arity’s use of personal information, please review the Arity privacy policy, which is located at <a href="https://www.arity.com/privacy" target="_self">https://www.arity.com/privacy</a>.</li>
<li>We share personal information with third-party partners that provide certain features and services you may use in connection with our Service. For example, depending on the features of the Service you have enabled, we provide your personal information and location data to emergency responders in the event we detect a crash. We also share personal information with third party partners that provide services and features available through our Premium subscriptions, such as Emergency Dispatch services. The third parties that provide Premium service features may ask you for additional information in order to provide the full range of services to you. Any information provided to these third parties will be governed by that third party’s own privacy policy.</li>
<li>We share personal information with third parties that you have connected to your Life360 account to facilitate the features or services. For example, if you enable the Life360 Action on any Google Assistant-enabled device or use other voice-assistant services, Life360 will respond to any query received through the Action and disclose your personal information we well as the personal information (such as name, current location, and other data) of your Circle members through screen display or audio response. Google and the equipment the Google Assistant is installed on, may record your interactions with the Action and the response data in accordance with your agreements with Google. You are solely responsible for the use of the Life360 Action to access information about your Circle members on your Assistant-enabled devices, including in the case of any unauthorized access to your device by a third party, and for the consequences of enabling the Action on any of your devices.</li>
<li>Other users may share your personal information in certain circumstances. For example, if a member of your Circle enables the Life360 Action on a Google Assistant-enabled device, your personal information (including name, current location and other data) may be displayed on screen or via audio response on any device with the Life360 Action enabled. This means your information may be available to other individuals who have access to your Circle member’s Assistant-enabled device or who may overhear your Circle member interacting with the Action. To prohibit this data sharing, you must ask your Circle member to disconnect his or her account from the Life360 Action or you can leave the Circle.</li>
<li>We use the hCaptcha anti-bot service by Intuition Machines, Inc. (“IMI”) on our website to check whether the data entered on our website has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, hCaptcha analyzes the behavior of the website or mobile app visitor based on various characteristics (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website or app, or mouse movements made by the user). This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website or mobile app visitor enters a part of the website or app with hCaptcha enabled and hCaptcha may take place completely in the background in “invisible mode.” The information collected through hCaptcha is shared with IMI, which processes the information on our behalf. For more information about hCaptcha and IMI's privacy policy and terms of use, please visit the following links: <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://hcaptcha.com/privacy/" target="_self">https://hcaptcha.com/privacy/</a></span> and <a href="https://hcaptcha.com/terms" target="_self"><span class="wysiwyg-underline">https://hcaptcha.com/terms</span></a>.</li>
<li>Any information or content that you voluntarily post to the website or to our Facebook page will automatically be available to the public. We may publicly post your reviews and comments online on our website or mobile app or link your reviews to third party websites.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other instances in which we may share your information: </strong>We may also share your information for business purposes, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We may share your personal information with our third-party business partners, vendors and consultants who perform services on our behalf or who help us provide our Services, such as accounting, managerial, technical, marketing or analytic services, and to other third-party partners or service providers who contractually agree to process personal information solely as necessary to provide services or features to our users.</li>
<li>We may at any time buy or sell/divest the company, or any combination of its products, services, assets and/or businesses.

You may not opt-out of Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, parental consent notification, order confirmations, change or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). &nbsp;You may also unsubscribe from receiving SMS text messages by replying “STOP” to the number sending the message.

<p><strong>Location and Movement Data Collection and Sharing:&nbsp; </strong>As described in Section 2, we collect precise location data and driving event and movement data (such as accelerometer data, magnetometer data, gyro data, etc.) from your device to provide the Life360 Services, and may share your personal information, including location and movement data, with other Life360 users in your Family Circle or other Circle you belong to, and with third parties for crash detection, research, analytics, attribution and tailored advertising purposes. You have many options to control this data collection and sharing activity through the App Settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limit location sharing with your Circle.</strong> You may turn location sharing “OFF” for one or more of your Circles through your App settings.&nbsp; If you turn off location sharing in one or more of your circles, we will not share your location with such Circles; however,&nbsp;we will continue to collect your location information in order to provide the Service (for example, to provide our emergency services, to share your location with the other Circles, or to provide location-based advertising). Note: if you press “Check In” or “Automated SOS” in the App, your location will update in <u>every</u> one of your Circles even if location sharing is turned off for one or more of your Circles.</li>
<li><strong>Limit Drive Detection. </strong>You can limit the collection and display of location and movement data through the Drive Detection feature in the in-App Privacy settings. When you turn Drive Detection “off,” your location is not visible to your Circles and your location and drive history will not show on Individual or Family Driver Reports. Please note that your Life360 app may not be able to provide all of our Services to you turn off Drive Detection. When Drive Detection is turned “off,” Crash Detection services will be disabled and safety services like SOS Help Alerts and 24/7 Dispatchers will not be available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Limit data sharing with third party data partners through in-App Privacy Settings.</strong> To opt-out of Life360 sharing personal information (including location and movement data) with data partners for targeted advertising, research, attribution and similar purposes, you can opt-out through the Do Not Sell My Personal Information page in the in-App Privacy &amp; Security settings. If you opt-out, Life360 will continue to collect your device location and movement data and to share such data with your Circles and with third parties as needed to support and provide the Life360 services or other services you engage, but we will no longer share data about you with our third party data partners for their own advertising and other commercial purposes. Please note, some third party data partners may continue to send you location-based ads based on your previous location or may approximate your location based on other data.</li>
<li><strong>Limit driving event sharing with Arity.</strong> We share data with our partner Arity to support important App features like driving behaviour and Crash Detection. Arity also uses data for research, to improve its analytics and predictive driving behavior models and improve its performance generally. To opt-out of permitting Arity to use and learn from your data for its own research and to develop and improve its predictive behavior models and products and services generally, you can opt-out through the Driving Services page in the in-App Privacy Settings. To opt-out of permitting Arity to use data for its own commercial purposes, including marketing, advertising, and for US users only to provide and service insurance company products and ads, you can opt-out through the Do Not Sell My Personal Information page in the in-App Privacy &amp; Security Settings.</li>
<li><strong>Disconnect Location Data and Movement Data in Device Settings. </strong>You may also be able to turn off device location data collection through your mobile device settings.&nbsp; For example, depending on your mobile device, you may be able to “Turn location services ‘off,’ which restricts access to your device location data. You can also adjust your device settings to withdraw permission for the Life360 app to access device location data and/or motion data (depending on the device type, this may be called “Fitness and Motion” data). Please note that your Life360 App may not be able to provide all of our Services to you if you disable access to location and movement data through your device settings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising:</strong>&nbsp;We may share information about your use of our Services over time, including location information, with third party ad networks, social media companies and other third parties so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on our Service as well as on other websites, apps or services, or on other devices or advertising channels. We may also display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and others. These third party ad partners collect and use information such as click stream information, timestamp, hashed email address, device ID or AdID, your use of third party applications and/or precise geolocation data and other information, and may combine this information with information they collect directly through tracking technologies or that they receive other partners, both online and offline, so that they may recognize you across other browsers or devices you use, including computers, mobile devices and Smart TVs. These third parties use this information to make the advertisements you see online more relevant to your interests, as well as to provide advertising-related services such as reporting, attribution, analytics, and market research.</p>

You must perform the opt-out on each browser or device you use.</li>
<li>Some of these opt-outs may not be effective unless your browser is set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, change your browser settings, switch browsers or computers, or use another operating system, you will need to opt-out again.</li>

<p><a name="children"></a> <strong>5.&nbsp; CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Life360 takes special precaution to protect the privacy of our younger users.&nbsp; Life360 does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 (a “child”) without verifiable consent of a parent or guardian and the Service is intended to be used by children under 13 only with significant parental involvement and approval.</p>
<p>If Life360 learns that we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child without parental consent, we will take appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account with our Service without your consent, please alert us immediately by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@life360.com">privacy@life360.com</a> so that we may delete that child’s personal information from our systems.</p>
<p>By enabling your child to create a user account and permitting your child to use the Service, you expressly agree to the practices described in this Children's Privacy Policy and you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your child's personal information as described herein.</p>
<p><strong><u>Setting up a child account</u>.&nbsp; </strong>If a parent wishes to add a user who is under 13 to the Service, we request the Parent provide verifiable consent through one of several methods, such as by verifying the Parent’s driver’s license or by submitting a parental consent form (available <span class="wysiwyg-underline"><a href="https://www.life360.com/pdf/consent.pdf" target="_self">here</a></span>) via mail or email. &nbsp;The child will then be able to participate in most aspects of the Life360 Service.</p>
<p><strong><u>Personal information we collect</u>.&nbsp; </strong>We take special precautions to collect only as much information as is reasonably necessary for the child to use the Service. As further described in our Privacy Policy above, we collect various types of personal information from all users of the Service. For example, we collect profile information (username, email address and mobile phone number) when a user creates an account and other types of personal information the user may provide during the course of using the Service, such as a nickname, favorite location, and emergency contact information. &nbsp;We collect information about a user’s device (e.g., IP address, device type/model/manufacture / operating system, and a unique ID that allows us to identify the browser, mobile device or account, such as a UDID, IDFA, Google AdID or similar)&nbsp; as well as certain usage information about the use of the Service (for example, whether the user opens emails) and we collect analytics data. We collect geolocation data through the device IP address, WiFi, Bluetooth and GPS coordinates available through the user’s mobile device and through technologies and sensors that may be nearby. We also collect driving event data through sensory and motion data sensors in the user’s mobile device (e.g., data from a smartphone’s gyroscope, accelerometer, compass and Bluetooth) in order to calculate and detect driving events such as hard braking, speeding and crash detection. Please review the section of our Privacy Policy called “<strong>How We Collect and Use Information</strong>” to learn more.</p>
<p><strong>Information sharing.&nbsp; </strong>Life360 may share or disclose a child’s personal information our third party vendors, service providers and business partners as described in our full privacy policy, including, for example, with third parties as needed to analyze and detect driving behavior data, perform analytics or otherwise , support the features and functionality of our Service such as crash detection. However, we do not share or sell personal information collected from the accounts of children under 13 for marketing or advertising purposes, nor permit our third party partners to collect and use such information for advertising purposes. Please review the section of our Privacy Policy called “<strong>Sharing of Your Information</strong>” to learn more about how we share information with our vendors, service providers and others.</p>
<p><strong>Sharing information with other Life360 users.&nbsp; </strong>The child’s profile information and location will be shared with other members of the Family Circle and any other Circle the child joins. Please note that if your child joins any other Circles, the child will be able to share his or her location with other members of that Circle and may exchange messages with those Circle members. <strong>You are responsible for monitoring your child’s account and location-sharing activity through the Service and for blocking or permitting location sharing features. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your Choices. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Contact Us.&nbsp; </strong>The Parent has a right to request to review or have deleted the child’s personal information and may withdraw consent for the Service to collect any further personal information from the child. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@life360.com">privacy@life360.com</a> to request to review and/or delete any personal information we have collected from the child, or to withdraw permission for Life360 to collect any additional information from the child.

We implement appropriate, commercially reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect your personal information against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, change or damage. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. We will never send you unsolicited emails or contact you by phone requesting your account ID, password, credit or debit card information or national identification numbers.</p>
<p>6.2&nbsp; <strong>International Transfers of your Personal Information</strong>. As we are located in the USA, any information we collect from you will initially be collected and stored in the USA. If you are in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, this may mean that your personal information will be stored in a jurisdiction that offers a level of protection that may, in certain instances, be less protective of your personal information than the jurisdiction you are typically resident in. We will implement appropriate safeguards to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with applicable EEA and UK privacy law and this privacy policy, including: (i) ensuring that we use your personal information in accordance with standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission for transfers of personal data to recipients outside the EEA and UK; and (ii) ensuring that any recipients of your personal information commit to the same standards. If you wish to enquire further about the safeguards used, please contact us using the details set out at the end of this privacy notice.</p>
<p>6.3&nbsp; <strong>Privacy Shield</strong>. We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union countries (including Lichtenstein, Norway and Iceland) and Switzerland transferred to the United States pursuant to the Privacy Shield ("<strong>Privacy Shield</strong>"). We have certified that we adhere to the Privacy Principles of notice, choice, accountability for onward transfer, security, data integrity, purpose limitation, access, and recourse, enforcement and liability ("<strong>Principles</strong>") with respect to such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this policy and the Principles, the Principles shall govern. To learn more about Privacy Shield, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce Privacy Shield website: https://www.privacyshield.gov/. As of September 2020, the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield has been invalidated. Nonetheless, we have committed to adhere to these Principles with respect to the protection of personal data to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
<p>6.4&nbsp; <strong>Onward Transfer. </strong>Where we transfer personal information to a third party, will take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure the third-party processes personal information for limited and specified purposes and in a manner consistent with our Privacy Shield obligations. Where the transfer is to a third-party agent acting on our behalf, we may be liable if such third parties fail to meet those obligations, and we are responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. In certain situations, we may be also required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
